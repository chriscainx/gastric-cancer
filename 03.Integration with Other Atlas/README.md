# Code and Example for Integration with Other Atlas

This folder contains the code and an html notebook of an example integration of two datasets (our data and Sathe et al. data).

- `Integration_Demo_Sathe_Dataset.Rmd` is the raw R markdown file for this example analysis.
- `Integration_Demo_Sathe_Dataset.md` is the markdown file for the compiled notebook.
- `figure/` contains the images of the notebook.
- `Integration_Demo_Sathe_Dataset.html` is the standalone rendered html notebook.

On GitHub, it is recommended to click the above `Integration_Demo_Sathe_Dataset.md` to directly read the vignette in browser.
